## **Bonding** Vega tokens to a Vega key
The allows a user with Vega Tokens on Ethereum to participate in Governance and Nominate their Stake to a [validator](distributed-ledger-glossary.md#validators). Note: this was previously known as "Staking", it can be done by creating an iStake event (see spec) on either the "Staking bridge" or the "Vesting Contract".

## Governance
Using Vega tokens to propose changes to the network or vote for against proposed changes.

## Nominate stake
The act of securing the Vega Network by putting your stake on a Vega validator node. Users who have nominated a node with thier stake will receive a proportional share of the infrastructure fees collected by that validator. If the Validator is not being rewarded fees (e.g. bad behaviour) users may re-delgate their stake to another node

## Self Staking
That act of putting Vega tokens on a Validator node that you are running
