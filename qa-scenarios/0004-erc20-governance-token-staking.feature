## Scenario: An ethereum key deposits unvested via the vesting contract, and vested tokens via the staking bridge, then tries to withdraw them via the wrong contract ğŸ’§
    # Given an ethereum key has called stake on the vesting contract with a balance of 200 
    # and an ethereum key has called stake on the staking bridge with a balance of 100

## Scenario: A vega party that has VEGA tokens in a Vega general account cannot withdraw them via the vesting contract ğŸ’§
    # Given a Vega party has a General account for the VEGA asset with a balance of 100

### Scenario: A vega party that has VEGA tokens in a Vega general account can withdraw them via the ERC20 bridge, then stake them via the staking bridgeğŸ’§
    # Given a Vega party has a General account for the VEGA asset with a balance of 100
    # and that key withdraws the asset balance via the ERC20 bridge
    # And that key receives the VEGA balance in their wallet
    # And that key calls stake on the staking bridge with a balance of 100
    # a stake_deposited event is emitted by the staking bridge contract
    # and the vega key has a staking account for the VEGA asset
    # and the vega key's staking account will have a balance of 100
    # and the vega key's general account will have a balance of 0

# Scenario: An ethereum key with staked, ested assets in the staking bridge can transfer the ownership to another ethereum key ğŸ’§ 
    # Note: This means that that key can no longer unstake those tokens
    #       But the on-vega balance remains untouched
