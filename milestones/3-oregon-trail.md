# Oregon Trail

* **Status**: Being confirmed
* **Overview**: ðŸ¤  Feature readiness for trading on mainnet.
* **Result**: A new network named Wild Westnet will be launched based on this milestone, which will point at Ethereum mainnet and be run with Validators none of which are controlled by the Vega team.
* **Project board**: https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/58
* **Target timings**: 6-8 weeks (late Feb to coinside with Eth Denver)

| **4** | Benchmark performance testing | We need to assess risks and resolve any found critical issues before trading is enabled | LINK? | @core | Core |
| **5** | Data node v2 | Because users of the protcol often need various data (price history / delegation history / transfers etc.) | [open PR](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/pull/763) | @Vegaklaus | Research</br>Front End</br>Core |
| **6** | ðŸ¤‘ Incentivised data-node implementation | Because we want to incentivise other parties to run instances of the data node. | [Project](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/92)| @davidsiska-vega | Core |
