# Sweetwater

* **Status**: Scope confirmed
* **Overview**: Really minimal mainnet that allows us to test validators running a minimal Vega network. This is a new network: Mainnet. There is no trading.
* **Result**: Part way through Oregon Trail, a network that can run, connected to Ethereum mainnet, with minimal features
* **Project board**: [💧 Sweetwater](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/79)
* **Open Source**: 🤷‍♂️
* **Date**: Must be a live network on 3rd September 2021

## Core
The following features are required for this network to be what we need.

### Features
| Priority | Feature | Because | Owner |
|:---------:|---------|---------|:------:|
|  **1** | [⚖ Settlement at Expiry](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/5) |  We don’t want a network that can’t settle. No oracle bot will exist. | @barnabee  |
| ✔️ | [🧛‍♀️&nbsp;Staking bridge](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/80) | Token holders with locked tokens want to stake. Governance must be updated to look at the staking account instead of the general account | - |
| ↪️ | [🐕 Validators](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/65)    | We will not be running any nodes         | Meeting on Monday 14th |
| **2** | [💀 Limited Network Life](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/70)  | This network will definitely be restarted. Some state needs to survive that restart. However we don’t checkpoint at bundles. Delegation needs to be specced.. | @davidsiska-vega |
| ↪️ | [👑 On-Chain Treasury](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/81) | There needs to be a pool of assets to reward people | -  |
| ↪️ | [👮‍♂️ Testnet Limits](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/44) | Depositing via the bridge will not be possible|  -   |
| ✔️ | [📧 Spam protection](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/82) | Reduce attack vectors | - |
| ✔️ | [A voted-on genesis block](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/issues/3648) | Token holders will have voted for it | -  

### Refactors
| Feature | Because | Status |
|---------|---------|:------:|
| ✔️ [uint shift](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/issues/3005) |  It’s in progress and will hold up future iteration. Let’s take the hit now  | In development  |
| ✔️ [API Split](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/56) | The nodes running in 💧 should represent the nodes running in 🤠 |  Ready for development |
