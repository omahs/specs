# Reward framework

The reward framework provides a mechanism for measuring and rewarding a number of key activties on the Vega network. 
These rewards operate in addition to the main protocol economic incentives which come from 
[fees](0029-FEES-fees.md) on every trade. 
These fees are the fundamental income stream for [liquidity providers LPs](0042-LIQF-setting_fees_and_rewarding_lps.md) and [validators](0061-REWP-simple_pos_rewards_sweetwater.md). 

The additional rewards described here can be funded arbitrarily by users of the network and may be used by the project team, token holders (via governance), and individual traders and market makers to incentivise mutually beneficial behaviour.
Note that transfers via governance, including to fund rewards, is a post-Oregon Trail feature.

Note that validator rewards (and the reward account for those) is covered in [validator rewards](0061-REWP-simple_pos_rewards_sweetwater.md) and is separate from the trading reward framework described here. 


## New network parameter for market creation threshold

The parameter `rewards.marketCreationQuantumMultiple` will be used together with [quantum](0040-ASSF-asset_framework.md) to asses market size when deciding whether a market qualifies for the payment of market creation rewards. 
It is reasonable to assume that `quantum` will be set to a value around `1 USD` (though there will likely be quite significant variation from this for assets that are not well correlated with USD).
Therefore, for example, to reward futures markets with traded notional over 1 mil USD, then this parameter should be set to around `1000000`. Any decimal value strictly greater than `0` is valid. 


## Reward metrics

For reward metrics we define a *market scope* as either:
- a set comprising one or more markets (by ID); or
- all markets sharing the same settlement asset, including markets proposed and created in future (as long as they exist by the time the applicable reward is paid out).

Reward metrics are scoped by *market scope*, which for all scopes is guaranteed to be a superset of the value of the metric for one or more individual markets (i.e. a party's metrics for the individual markets comprising a scope may be summed to obtain the same party's metric for the scope).

With the exception of the market creation reward metrics, reward metrics are reset at the end of each epoch.

Reward metrics and payouts will be calculated at the end of every epoch for each [party, *market scope*] combination, where:
- the party has accrued a reward metric `>0` for the *market scope*
- there are non-zero rewards in the reward account for the *market scope* to be paid in at least one asset.

Reward metrics in [LNL checkpoints](./0073-LIMN-limited_network_life.md):
- Market activity reward metrics are not stored in LNL checkpoints and are reset after a checkpoint restart.
- Market creation reward metrics (both each market's `cumulative volume` and the flags to identify when a market has already been rewarded for a given [*market scope*, payout asset] combination) are stored in LNL checkpointd and will be restored after a checkpoint restart.


### Market activity (fee based) reward metrics

There will be the following market activity reward metrics calculated based on fees (as a proxy for activity):
1. Sum of maker fees paid 
1. Sum of maker fees received
1. Sum of LP fees received


### Market creation reward metrics

There will be the following market creation reward metric calculated to reward creation of markets achieving at least a minimum lifetime trading volume, as a proxy for identifying the creation of useful markets:
1. Where `cumulative volume` is defined as the cumulative total [trade value for fee purposes](0029-FEES-fees.md) generated by the market since its creation:
   - **IF** `cumulative volume < rewards.marketCreationQuantumMultiple * quantum` (where `rewards.marketCreationQuantumMultiple` is a network parameter, and [quantum is described here](0040-ASSF-asset_framework.md)) **THEN** `market creation metric := 0`
   - **ELSE IF** any non-zero market creation reward has previously been paid out for this [*market scope*, payout asset] combination **THEN** `market creation metric := 0`
   - **ELSE** `market creation metric := cumulative volume`


## Reward accounts

Trading reward accounts are defined by the payment asset (the asset in which the reward is paid out), the *market scope*, and the reward type (metric). That is, there can be multiple rewards with the same type paid in different assets for the same *market scope*.
Similarly, their may be separate reward accounts for the same payment asset for different *market scopes*, including where some markets may appear in two or more of these *market scopes*, and thus receive payouts in the same payout asset from multiple reward accounts.

It must be possible for any party to run a one off [transfer](0057-TRAN-transfers.md) or create a [recurring transfer](0057-TRAN-transfers.md) to any of these reward accounts. 

Note that the market settlement asset has nothing to do in particular with the asset used to pay out a reward for the market for any of the relevant trading rewards. 
That is, a participant might recieve rewards in the settlement asset of the market, in VEGA governance tokens, and in any number of other unrelated tokens (perhaps governance of "loyalty"/reward tokens issued by LPs or market creators, or stablecoins like DAI).

Reward accounts and balances must be saved in [LNL checkpoints](./0073-LIMN-limited_network_life.md) to ensure all funds remain accounted for accross a restart.


## Reward distribution

All rewards are paid out at the end of any epoch *after* [recurring transfers](0057-TRAN-Transfers.md) have been executed. 
The entire reward account balance is paid out every epoch unless the total value of the metric over all parties is zero (there are no fractional payouts). 
There are no payout delays, rewards are paid out instantly at epoch end.


### For fee based metrics

Every epoch the entire reward account for every [*market scope*, metric type, payout asset] will be distributed pro-rata by the party's metric value to the parties that have metric values `>0`. 

That is if we have reward account balance `R` and parties `p_1 – p_n` eligible for the metric and the *market scope* in question:
```
[p_1,m_1]
[p_2,m_2]
...
[p_n,m_n]
```
then calculate `M:= m_1+m_2+...+m_n` and transfer `R x m_i / M` to party `p_i` at the end of each epoch. 
If `M = 0` (no-one incurred or received fees as specified by the metric type for a given *market scope*) then nothing is paid out of the reward account for that *market scope* and the balance rolls into next epoch. 

Metrics are reset to zero for all parties at the end of the epoch.
In the case where the reward account balance for a given payout asset is 0 at the end of the epoch for a given *market scope*, the participants contributing to the relevant metric will not be compensated in that payout asset for their contribution during that epoch. 
Their contribution to fees is not being carried over to the next epoch.
If there is no reward account balance for any payout asset for a given metric and market (i.e. the market does not appear in any *market scopes* with a non-zero reward account balance) then participants in that market will receive no rewards at all for their contributions to the metric in question.

Metrics will be calculated using the [decimal precision of the settlement asset](0070-MKTD-market-decimal-places.md).


### For market creation metrics

Every epoch the entire reward account for every [*market scope*, payout asset] will be distributed to the parties that submitted the original market creation governance proposal for any markets that have the market creation metric (described above) `>0`. 
The payout for each market having a non-zero market creation metric will be the same, that is, the eligible markets share the reward account balance equally. 
This means that the total market creation reward received by a party can vary, as their reward may reflect having created multiple eligible markets, each of which earns the same payout.

That is, if we have:
- reward account balance: `R` of some asset
- number of markets with a non-zero market creation metric: `n`
- parties `p_1 … p_n` being the creators of the markets with non-zero market creation metrics, where the creator is defined as the party that submitted the original market proposal that was enacted to create the market

Then transfer `R / M` to each party `p_i` (`i` from `1 to n`) identified above. 
If `n = 0` (i.e. no markets newly met or exceeded the reward threshold since the last payout) then nothing is paid out of the reward account and the balance rolls into next epoch. 

Market creation metrics are **not reset** at the end of the epoch or during network restarts (including from LNL checkpoints), so the cumulative volume for each market continues to accrue across epochs and is always equal to the total trade value for fee purposes since the creation of the market.
Tracking of which markets have received market creation rewards for each [*market scope*, payout asset] combination is **not reset** at the end of the epoch or during netowrk restarts (including from LNL checkpoints), so each market proposal can only ever generate a single reward payout for any given [*market scope*, payout asset combination].

Metrics will be calculated using the [decimal precision of the settlement asset](0070-MKTD-market-decimal-places.md).


## Acceptance criteria

### Funding reward accounts (<a name="0056-REWA-001" href="#0056-REWA-001">0056-REWA-001</a>)

Trading reward accounts are defined by a pair: [`payout_asset, dispatch_strategy`].

There are two assets configured on the Vega chain: $VEGA and USDT. 

Setup a recurring transfer of 1000 $VEGA with the following dispatch strategy: asset=USDT, metric=DISPATCH_METRIC_TAKER_FEES_PAID, markets=[].
Create 3 markets settling in USDT. Wait for a new epoch to begin, in the next epoch generate fees in the markets with the following distribution:
Market1 contributes 20% of the fees, market2 contributes 30% of the fees and market3 contributes 50% of the fees - e.g. in market1 200 USDT were paid in taker fees, in market2 300 USDT and in market3 500. At the time the transafer is distributed, expect the reward accounts for the corresponding markets are funded proportionally to the contribution defined above, so if the transfer is of 1000 $VEGA, then market1 is funded with 200, market2 is funded with 300 and market3 is funded with 500. 

Run for another epoch with no fee generated. Expect no transfer to be made to the reward pools of the accounts. 

### Funding reward accounts - with markets in scope (<a name="0056-REWA-002" href="#0056-REWA-002">0056-REWA-002</a>)
There are two assets configured on the Vega chain: $VEGA and USDT. 

Setup a recurring transfer of 1000 $VEGA with the following dispatch strategy: asset=USDT, metric=DISPATCH_METRIC_TAKER_FEES_PAID, markets=[market1, market2].
Create 3 markets settling in USDT. Wait for a new epoch to begin, in the next epoch generate fees in the markets with the following distribution:
Market1 contributes 20% of the fees, market2 contributes 30% of the fees and market3 contributes 50% of the fees - e.g. in market1 200 USDT were paid in taker fees, in market2 300 USDT and in market3 500. At the time the transafer is distributed, expect the reward accounts for the corresponding markets are funded proportionally to the contribution defined above, so if the transfer is of 1000 $VEGA, then market1 is funded with 400, market2 is funded with 600 and market3 is funded with 0. 

Run for another epoch with no fee generated. Expect no transfer to be made to the reward pools of the accounts. 

### Distributing fees paid rewards (<a name="0056-REWA-010" href="#0056-REWA-010">0056-REWA-010</a>)

#### Rationale
A market has 2 reward accounts for the metric, one paying in $VEGA and the other paying in USDC. 

#### Setup
There are 3 assets configured on the Vega chain: $VEGA, USDT, USDC. 
There are no markets.

* `transfer.fee.factor` = 0
* `maker_fee` = 0.0001
* `infrastructure_fee` = 0.0002
*  `ETHUSD-MAR22` market which settles in USDT is launched anytime in epoch 1 by `party_0`
* `party_0` and `party_1` provide auction orders so there is a trade to leave the opening auction and the remaining best bid = 2700 and and best offer = 2800 are supplied by party_0 each with volume 10. 
* Moreover `party_0` provides liquidity with `liquidity_fee` = 0.0003 and offset + 10 (so their LP volume lands on 2690 and 2810).
* During epoch `2` we have `party_1` make one buy market order with volume `2`.
* During epoch `2` we have `party_2` make one sell market order each with notional `1`.

#### Funding reward accounts
* `party_R` is funding multiple reward accounts for the same metric and same market to be paid in different assets (`$VEGA`, `USDC`)
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of fees paid | VEGA` in epoch `2`. (`ETHUSD-MAR22` is just for brevity here, the transfer is specified by market id not its name).
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `USDC` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of fees paid | USDC` in epoch `2`. (`ETHUSD-MAR22` is just for brevity here, the transfer is specified by market id not its name).


#### Expectation
At the end of epoch 2 the metric `sum of fees paid` for `party_1` should be:
```
2 x 2800 x (0.0001 + 0.0002 + 0.0003) = 3.36
```
and for `party_2` it is:
```
1 x 2700 x (0.0001 + 0.0002 + 0.0003) = 1.62
```

At the end of epoch 2:
* `party_1` is paid `90 x 3.36 / 4.98 = 60.72.` $VEGA from the reward account into its $VEGA general account. 
* `party_2` is paid `90 x 1.62 / 4.98 = 29.28.` $VEGA from the reward account into its $VEGA general account. 
* `party_1` is paid `120 x 3.36 / 4.98 = 80.96.` USDC from the reward account into its USDC general account. 
* `party_2` is paid `120 x 1.62 / 4.98 = 39.03.` USDC from the reward account into its USDC general account. 

### Distributing fees paid rewards - unfunded account (<a name="0056-REWA-011" href="#0056-REWA-011">0056-REWA-011</a>)

#### Rationale
This is identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-010" href="#0056-REWA-010">0056-REWA-010</a>) just without funding the corresponding reward account. 

#### Setup
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-010" href="#0056-REWA-010">0056-REWA-010</a>)

#### Funding reward accounts
No funding done.

#### Expectation
At the end of epoch 2 although there was trading in the market `ETHUSD-MAR22`, no reward is given to any participant as the reward account was not funded. 

### Distributing fees paid rewards - funded account - no trading activity (<a name="0056-REWA-012" href="#0056-REWA-012">0056-REWA-012</a>)
#### Rationale 
After having an epoch with trading activity, fund the reward account, but have no trading activity and assert that no payout is made. 

#### Setup
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-010" href="#0056-REWA-010">0056-REWA-010</a>)

#### Funding reward accounts
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-010" href="#0056-REWA-010">0056-REWA-010</a>)

Then, during epoch 3 we fund the reward accounts for the metric: 
* `party_R` is funding multiple reward accounts for the same metric and same market to be paid in different assets (`$VEGA`, `USDC`)
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of fees paid | $VEGA` in epoch `3`. (`ETHUSD-MAR22` is just brevity, this should be the market id not name).
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `USDC` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of fees paid | $USDC` in epoch `3`. (`ETHUSD-MAR22` is just brevity, this should be the market id not name).

#### Expectation
Looking only at epoch 3 - as no trading activity was done, we expect the reward balances in both $VEGA and USDC for the metric to remain unchanged. 

### Distributing fees paid rewards - multiple markets (<a name="0056-REWA-013" href="#0056-REWA-013">0056-REWA-013</a>)
#### Rationale 
There are multiple markets, each paying its own reward where due. 

#### Setup
There are 3 assets configured on the Vega chain: $VEGA, USDT, USDC. 
There are no markets.

* `transfer.fee.factor` = 0
* `maker_fee` = 0.0001
* `infrastructure_fee` = 0.0002
*  `ETHUSD-MAR22` market which settles in USDT is launched anytime in epoch 1 by `party_0`
*  `ETHUSD-JUN22` market which settles in USDC is launched anytime in epoch 1 by `party_0`
* For each market in {`ETHUSD-MAR22`, `ETHUSD-JUN22`}
    * `party_0` and `party_1` provide auction orders so there is a trade to leave the opening auction and the remaining best bid = 2700 and and best offer = 2800 are supplied by party_0 each with volume 10. 
    * Moreover `party_0` provides liquidiity with `liquidity_fee` = 0.0003 and offset + 10 (so their LP volume lands on 2690 and 2810).
    * During epoch `2` we have `party_1` make one buy market order with volume `2`.
    * During epoch `2` we have `party_2` make one sell market order each with notional `1`.

#### Funding reward accounts
* `party_R` is funding multiple the reward accounts for both markets: 
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of fees paid | $VEGA` in epoch `2`.
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-JUN22 | Sum of fees paid | $VEGA` in epoch `2`.

#### Expectation
The calculation of eligibility is identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-010" href="#0056-REWA-010">0056-REWA-010</a>) but the expected payout is:
* for market `ETHUSD-MAR22`:
    * `party_1` is paid `90 x 3.36 / 4.98 = 60.72.` $VEGA from the reward account into its $VEGA general account. 
    * `party_2` is paid `90 x 1.62 / 4.98 = 29.28.` $VEGA from the reward account into its $VEGA general account. 
* for market `ETHUSD-Jun22`:
    * `party_1` is paid `120 x 3.36 / 4.98 = 80.96.` $VEGA from the reward account into its $VEGA general account. 
    * `party_2` is paid `120 x 1.62 / 4.98 = 39.03.` $VEGA from the reward account into its $VEGA general account. 

### Distributing maker fees received rewards (<a name="0056-REWA-020" href="#0056-REWA-020">0056-REWA-020</a>)

#### Rationale
A market has 2 reward accounts for the metric, one paying in $VEGA and the other paying in USDC. 

#### Setup
There are 3 assets configured on the Vega chain: $VEGA, USDT, USDC. 
There are no markets.

* `transfer.fee.factor` = 0
* `maker_fee` = 0.0001
* `infrastructure_fee` = 0.0002
*  `ETHUSD-MAR22` market which settles in USDT is launched anytime in epoch 1 by `party_0`
* `party_0` and `party_1` provide auction orders so there is a trade to leave the opening auction and the remaining best bid = 2700 and and best offer = 2800 are supplied by party_0 each with volume 10. 
* Moreover `party_0` provides liquidiity with `liquidity_fee` = 0.0003 and offset + 10 (so their LP volume lands on 2690 and 2810).
* During epoch 2 `party_1` puts a limit buy order of vol 10 at 2710 and a limit sell order of vol 10 at 2790
* After that, during epoch 2 `party_2` puts in a market buy order of volume 20.

#### Funding reward accounts
* `party_R` is funding multiple reward accounts for the same metric and same market to be paid in different assets (`$VEGA`, `USDC`)
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of maker fees received | VEGA` in epoch `2`. 
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `USDC` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of maker fees received | USDC` in epoch `2`. 

#### Expectation
At the end of epoch `2` the metric `sum of maker fees received` for `party_1` should be:
```
10 x 2790 x 0.0001 = 2.79
```
and for `party_0` it is 
```
10 x 2800 x 0.0001 = 2.8
```

At the end of epoch `2` `party_1` is paid `90 x 2.79 / (2.79+2.8)` $VEGA from the reward account into its `$VEGA` general account. 
At the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `90 x 2.8 / (2.79+2.8)` $VEGA from the reward account into its `$VEGA` general account. 
At the end of epoch `2` `party_1` is paid `120 x 2.79 / (2.79+2.8)` USDC from the reward account into its `USDC` general account. 
At the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `120 x 2.8 / (2.79+2.8)` USDC from the reward account into its `USDC` general account. 


### Distributing maker fees received rewards - unfunded account (<a name="0056-REWA-021" href="#0056-REWA-021">0056-REWA-021</a>)

#### Rationale
This is identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-020" href="#0056-REWA-020">0056-REWA-020</a>) just without funding the corresponding reward account. 

#### Setup
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-020" href="#0056-REWA-020">0056-REWA-020</a>).

#### Funding reward accounts
No funding done.

#### Expectation
At the end of epoch 2 although there was trading in the market `ETHUSD-MAR22`, no reward is given to any participant as the reward account was not funded. 

### Distributing maker fees received  rewards - funded account - no trading activity (<a name="0056-REWA-022" href="#0056-REWA-022">0056-REWA-022</a>)
#### Rationale 
After having an epoch with trading activity, fund the reward account, but have no trading activity and assert that no payout is made. 

#### Setup
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-020" href="#0056-REWA-020">0056-REWA-020</a>)

#### Funding reward accounts
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-020" href="#0056-REWA-020">0056-REWA-020</a>)

Then, during epoch 3 we fund the reward accounts for the metric: 
* `party_R` is funding multiple reward accounts for the same metric and same market to be paid in different assets (`$VEGA`, `USDC`)
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of maker fees received | VEGA` in epoch `3`. 
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `USDC` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of maker fees received | USDC` in epoch `3`. 

#### Expectation
Looking only at epoch 3 - as no trading activity was done, we expect the reward balances in both $VEGA and USDC for the metric to remain unchanged. 

### Distributing maker fees received rewards - multiple markets (<a name="0056-REWA-023" href="#0056-REWA-023">0056-REWA-023</a>)
#### Rationale 
There are multiple markets, each paying its own reward where due. 

#### Setup

There are no markets.

* `transfer.fee.factor` = 0
* `maker_fee` = 0.0001
* `infrastructure_fee` = 0.0002
*  `ETHUSD-MAR22` market which settles in USDT is launched anytime in epoch 1 by `party_0`
*  `ETHUSD-JUN22` market which settles in USDC is launched anytime in epoch 1 by `party_0`
* For each market in {`ETHUSD-MAR22`, `ETHUSD-JUN22`}
    * `party_0` and `party_1` provide auction orders so there is a trade to leave the opening auction and the remaining best bid = 2700 and and best offer = 2800 are supplied by party_0 each with volume 10. 
    * Moreover `party_0` provides liquidiity with `liquidity_fee` = 0.0003 and offset + 10 (so their LP volume lands on 2690 and 2810).
    * During epoch 2 `party_1` puts a limit buy order of vol 10 at 2710 and a limit sell order of vol 10 at 2790
    * After that, during epoch 2 `party_2` puts in a market buy order of volume 20.

#### Funding reward accounts
* `party_R` is funding multiple the reward accounts for both markets: 
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of maker fees received | $VEGA` in epoch `2`.
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-JUN22 | Sum of maker fees received | $VEGA` in epoch `2`.

#### Expectation
The calculation of eligibility is identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-020" href="#0056-REWA-020">0056-REWA-020</a>) but the expected payout is:
* for market `ETHUSD-MAR22`:

    * At the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `90 x 2.8 / (2.79+2.8)` $VEGA from the reward account into its `$VEGA` general account. 

* for market `ETHUSD-Jun22`:
    * At the end of epoch `2` `party_1` is paid `120 x 2.79 / (2.79+2.8)` USDC from the reward account into its `$VEGA` general account. 
    * At the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `120 x 2.8 / (2.79+2.8)` USDC from the reward account into its `$VEGA` general account.

```
At the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `90` `$VEGA` from the reward account into its `$VEGA` general account. 
At the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `120` `USDC` from the reward account into its `USDC` general account. 


### Distributing LP fees received rewards - unfunded account (<a name="0056-REWA-031" href="#0056-REWA-031">0056-REWA-031</a>)

No funding done.

#### Expectation
At the end of epoch 2 although there was trading in the market `ETHUSD-MAR22`, no reward is given to any participant as the reward account was not funded. 

### Distributing maker fees received  rewards - funded account - no trading activity (<a name="0056-REWA-032" href="#0056-REWA-032">0056-REWA-032</a>)
#### Rationale 
After having an epoch with trading activity, fund the reward account, but have no trading activity and assert that no payout is made. 

#### Setup
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-030" href="#0056-REWA-030">0056-REWA-030</a>)

#### Funding reward accounts
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-030" href="#0056-REWA-030">0056-REWA-030</a>)

Then, during epoch 3 we fund the reward accounts for the metric: 
* `party_R` is funding multiple reward accounts for the same metric and same market to be paid in different assets (`$VEGA`, `USDC`)
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of LP fees received | VEGA` in epoch `3`. 
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `USDC` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of LP fees received | USDC` in epoch `3`. 

#### Expectation
Looking only at epoch 3 - as no trading activity was done, we expect the reward balances in both $VEGA and USDC for the metric to remain unchanged. 

### Distributing LP fees received - multiple markets (<a name="0056-REWA-33" href="#0056-REWA-033">0056-REWA-033</a>)
#### Rationale 
There are multiple markets, each paying its own reward where due. 

#### Setup
Identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-023" href="#0056-REWA-023">0056-REWA-023</a>)

#### Funding reward accounts
* `party_R` is funding multiple the reward accounts for both markets: 
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `90` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-MAR22 | Sum of LP fees received | $VEGA` in epoch `2`.
   * `party_R` makes a transfer of `120` `$VEGA` to `ETHUSD-JUN22 | Sum of LP fees received | $VEGA` in epoch `2`.

#### Expectation
The calculation of eligibility is identical to (<a name="0056-REWA-030" href="#0056-REWA-030">0056-REWA-030</a>) but the expected payout is:

* for market `ETHUSD-MAR22`:
    * At the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `90` `$VEGA` from the reward account into its `$VEGA` general account. 
    
* for market `ETHUSD-Jun22`:
    * t the end of epoch `2` `party_0` is paid `120` `USDC` from the reward account into its `USDC` general account. 


### Distributing market creation rewards - no eligibility (<a name="0056-REWA-040" href="#0056-REWA-040">0056-REWA-040</a>)
#### Rationale 
Market has been trading but not yet eligible for proposer bonus. 

#### Setup
* Setup a market ETHUSDT settling in USDT.
* The value of `marketCreationQuantumMultiple` is `10^6` and `quantum` for `USDT` is `1`. 
* Setup and fund multiple reward account for the market ETHUSDT:
    * Transfer 10000 $VEGA to `ETHUSDT | market creation | $VEGA` 
    * Transfer 20000 USDC to `ETHUSDT | market creation | USDC` 
* start trading in the market such that traded value for fee purposes in USDT is less than 10^6

#### Expectation
At the end of the epoch no payout has been made for the market ETHUSDT and the reward account balances should remain unchanged.


### Distributing market creation rewards - eligible are paid no more than once (<a name="0056-REWA-041" href="#0056-REWA-041">0056-REWA-041</a>)
#### Rationale 
Market has been trading but not yet eligible for proposer bonus. 

#### Setup
* Setup a market ETHUSDT settling in USDT.
* The value of `marketCreationQuantumMultiple` is `10^6` and `quantum` for `USDT` is `1`. 
* Setup and fund multiple reward account for the market ETHUSDT:
    * Transfer 10000 $VEGA to `ETHUSDT | market creation | $VEGA` 
    * Transfer 20000 USDC to `ETHUSDT | market creation | USDC` 
* start trading in the market such that traded value for fee purposes in USDT is less than 10^6
* During the epoch 2 let the traded value be greater than 10^6

#### Expectation
At the end of the epoch 2 the proposer of the market ETHUSDT is paid 10000 `$VEGA` and 20000 `USDC`

Then during epoch 3 make the following transfers:
* Transfer 10000 $VEGA to `ETHUSDT | market creation | $VEGA` 
* Transfer 20000 USDC to `ETHUSDT | market creation | USDC` 

At the end of epoch 3 make sure that no payout is made from the reward account as the proposer of the market has already been paid the proposer bonus once.

### Distributing market creation rewards - missed opportunity (<a name="0056-REWA-042" href="#0056-REWA-042">0056-REWA-042</a>)
#### Rationale 
Market goes above the threshold in trading value in an epoch before the reward account for the market for the reward type has any balance - therefore the proposer will not get compensated, not now, not ever. 

#### Setup
* Setup a market ETHUSDT settling in USDT.
* The value of `marketCreationQuantumMultiple` is `10^6` and `quantum` for `USDT` is `1`. 
* start trading in the market such that trading volume in USDT is less than 10^6
* During the epoch 2 let the traded value be greater than 10^6
* in Epoch 3 setup and fund multiple reward account for the market ETHUSDT:
    * Transfer 10000 $VEGA to `ETHUSDT | market creation | $VEGA` 
    * Transfer 20000 USDC to `ETHUSDT | market creation | USDC` 

#### Expectation
At the end of the epoch 2 and at the end of epoch 3 no payout has been made for the market ETHUSDT and the reward account balances should remain unchanged.
