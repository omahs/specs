At this point, we cannot reject a transaction based on any data that is not the shared state 
of the blockchain. This means, it is unavoidable that one spammer can essentially fill a block.
What we can do is
- remove the offending transactions after the block is sheduled, i.e., not process them
- update the state once a block is finalized and block transactions based on the new state
- delete transactions from every (honest) validators mempool based on the new state.

Thus, no matter what the anti-spam policy is, there is a scenario where someone creates
a lot of identities and spams one block with each. Therefore, we have to enforce a minimum
investment to be allowed to send anything to the Vega network.

For governance votes, that means that there is a minimum amount of tokens required to be allowed
to issue a proposal/vote on one. If the network detects successfull spam in spite of this minimum,
then the limit can be increased automatically.

For SW, we only have governance, so the following two policies will do:

Vote proposals can only be done using a lot of tokens (say, 100.0000), or through v1 tokens (the latter is the current proposal)
Any qualified voter can vote three times per epoch per active proposal (i.e., one initial vote and twice change their mind).

Initially, a qualified voter required at least 100 tokens (i.e., a value of $1500 taking the last coinlsit sale).
Thus, spamming the network for 1 minute would cost $135.000. 
If 3 blocks in a row for filled with spam i.e., parties sending substantially more than 3 votes, let's say 50 votes), 
then the number of required tokens is doubled, up to a maximum of 1600 (if someone pays 1.5 million to spam us for 60 
secondsso be it).

All parameters are up to discussion/governance vote.
